        <div class="abouttext">
            <p>My name is Jack Williams, I am a freelance videographer, video editor and photographer.</p>
            <p>In the past year I have learnt a lot by getting my first two freelance opportunities: using various cameras during live events in both videography and photography, developing my video editing knowledge and skills with large and small scale projects, as well as graphic design and illustration.</p>
            <p>In my spare time I am learning code/programming, becoming advanced in HTML and CSS, and beginning to learn Tailwind, React and JavaScript.</p>
            <p>I would love to become a drone pilot as I am fascinated by aerial cinematography. Gradually building up my equipment and qualifications, this and many other things will become a reality soon.</p>
            <p>For work enquiries please contact me via my email - peter.jack.williams@gmail.com</p>
