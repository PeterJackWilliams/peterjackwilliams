    <font class= "abouttype">I am a young and developing editor, fluent in Adobe Premiere Pro, and have a sound knowledge
    and continuing to learn Illustrator and After Affects. I am passionate about storytelling,
    and it excites me to know that these tools will help me to create and tell stories in new and 
    developing ways. I also love learning software and having challenges to solve and overcome. I have 
    also had tutorials and experience working with Avid and DaVinci Resolve.
    At university I gained vital experience in the film and television industry, working for a TEDx 
    Production as a camera operator; camera and editor for BMW Dick Lovett, for the arrival of the new i8,
    M5 and M6, and various other projects throughout the three years.
    Since graduating I have had experience working with Hungry Gap Productions, 
    a Bristol based production company, as a runner for 'The Hairy Bikers Home for Christmas' series.
    I shadowed the editor and worked alongside him to produce a cutaway sequence. 
    During my experience I gained an overall insight into the working mechanisms of a professional
    production company.</font>
