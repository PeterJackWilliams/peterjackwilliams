        <h1 class="mbm abouttitle">ABOUT</h1>

        <div class="abouttext">
            <p>As a post-production editor, I am proficient using Adobe Premiere Pro (5 years) and Final Cut Pro (1 year). I am able to work with large amounts of footage (8 hours) and condense down into 15-minute edits. I am able to curate shorter intricate, and engaging videos for YouTube and Instagram.</p>
            <p>Staying organised and setting simple and methodical workflows is something I bring to every edit I complete. Skilful in creating effective storylines and meaningful narratives, both linear and non-linear, recipe videos to wedding videos, with a great sense of pace and timing. I have a keen eye for detail when it comes to colour grading with DaVinci Resolve and Lumetri in Premiere. My editing knowledge is reinforced by learning other software including Avid and Pro Tools from industry professionals, and other Adobe programmes including Illustrator, After Affects and Photoshop.</p>
            <p>My secondary skills include website design, using HTML and CSS, and currently learning Java Script.</p>
            <p>Please contact me with any enquiries via my email – peter.jack.williams@gmail.com</p>
