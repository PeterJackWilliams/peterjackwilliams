        <p class="">
            My name is Jack, hello my name is jack !!!! I graduated from university in 2017 in Film, Television and Digital Production. 
            I am a young and developing editor fluent in Adobe Premiere Pro and have a keen interest and skill 
            using cameras; working as a DOP on a variety of projects. I have experience working in productions 
            for companies including TedX Conferences, BMW Dick Lovett and Hungry Gap, and small scale productions 
            including Jamie Cullum live at Bath Spa, independent films, and university projects.

            University was the perfect opportunity to flourish and learn; I purchased a DSLR camera and the 
            creative cloud in first year, I learnt through making experimental short films, personal vlogs and 
            documentaries, to become familiar with the equipment and software. I was also tutored in these areas, 
            learning how to apply the skills I had learnt to an industry standard. This included training in 
            Adobe Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, Pro Tools edit suite, and to a lesser level, Avid. 

            Since, I have worked for a BBC production company, as a runner; here I received a firm insight 
            into the working mechanisms of a professional television environment. I assisted an editor to 
            piece together a cut away sequence; shadowed the producer, director and camera operators, 
            liaised with the talent and guests; learnt sound recording techniques, and delivered the set 
            to the film location.

            From November 2017 to March 2018 I was travelling, visiting countries including Myanmar, Singapore, 
            Australia and New Zealand. The experience taught me a lot about different cultures, the kindness in 
            the world, and to respect home comforts.

            I am now in the process of gaining further experience and jobs within the film and television 
            industry.
