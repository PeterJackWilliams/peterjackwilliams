<main class="about">
    
<p class="abouttext" I am a young and developing editor, fluent in Adobe Premiere Pro, 
        and have a sound knowledge and continuing to learn Illustrator and After Affects. 
        I am passionate about storytelling, and it excites me to know that these tools will 
        help me to create and tell stories in new and developing ways. I also love learning
        software and having challenges to solve and overcome. I have also had tutorials and 
        experience working with Avid and DaVinci Resolve. I have been invloved in productions 
        with companies including TedX, BMW and BBC. Since graduating I have had experience 
        working with Hungry Gap Productions, a Bristol based production company, 
        as a runner for The Hairy Bikers Home for Christmas show. I shadowed the editor; 
        it was great learning from an industry professional.</p>
