        <p class="">
            I am a young and developing editor, fluent in Adobe Premiere Pro, and have a sound knowledge
            and continuing to learn Illustrator and After Affects. I am passionate about storytelling,
            and it excites me to know that these tools will help me to create and tell stories in new and
            developing ways. I also love learning software and having challenges to solve and overcome. I have
            also had tutorials and experience working with Avid and DaVinci Resolve.
            At university I gained vital experience in the film and television industry, working for a TEDx
            Production as a camera operator; camera and editor for BMW Dick Lovett, for the arrival of the new i8,
            M5 and M6, and various other projects throughout the three years.
            Since graduating I have had experience working with Hungry Gap Productions,
            a Bristol based production company, as a runner for 'The Hairy Bikers Home for Christmas' series.
            I shadowed the editor and worked alongside him to produce a cutaway sequence.
            During my experience I gained an overall insight into the working mechanisms of a professional
            production company.
