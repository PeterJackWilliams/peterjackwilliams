    <a class="abouttext">I am a young and developing editor, fluent in Adobe Premiere Pro,
        and have a sound knowledge and continuing to learn Illustrator 
        and After Affects. I am passionate about storytelling, and it 
        excites me to know that these tools will help me to create and 
        tell stories in new and developing ways. I also love learning 
        software and having challenges to solve and overcome. I have also 
        had tutorials and experience working with Avid and DaVinci Resolve.
        At university I gained vital experience in the film and television 
        industry, working for a TEDx Production as a camera operator; BMW 
        Dick Lovett for the arrival of the new i8, M5 and M6, and various 
        other projects. Since graduating I have had experience working with 
        Hungry Gap Productions, a Bristol based production company, 
        as a runner for 'The Hairy Bikers Home for Christmas' series. 
        I shadowed the editor and worked alongside him to produce a cutaway sequence, 
        and also gained an overall insight into the working mechanisms of a professional 
        production company.</a>
