        <p class="mbm abouttitle">ABOUT</p>

        <div class="abouttext">
            <p>As a post-production editor, I am proficient using Adobe Premiere Pro (5 years). And as a Videographer I have experience with a range of cameras including the Lumix GH5s, GH4, Canon 5D, and Sony A7iii.</p>
            <p>Staying organised and setting simple and methodical workflows is something I bring to every edit I complete. Skilful in creating effective storylines and meaningful narratives, both linear and non-linear, wedding videos to instructional recipe videos, to short films, with great pace and timing. I have a keen eye for detail when it comes to colour grading with DaVinci Resolve and Lumetri in Premiere. My editing knowledge is reinforced by learning other software including Avid and Pro Tools from industry professionals, and other Adobe programmes including Illustrator, After Effects and Photoshop.</p>
            <p>Please contact me with any enquiries via my email – peter.jack.williams@gmail.com</p>
